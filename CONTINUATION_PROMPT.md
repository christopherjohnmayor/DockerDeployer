# DockerDeployer: Documentation and CI/CD Implementation

Building on our progress with the testing framework and authentication system, let's implement the remaining components of the DockerDeployer project. Focus on the following tasks:

## 1. API Documentation with OpenAPI

Enhance the FastAPI application with comprehensive OpenAPI documentation:

```python
# Example for enhancing an endpoint with OpenAPI documentation
@app.get(
    "/containers",
    response_model=List[ContainerSchema],
    summary="List all containers",
    description="Returns a list of all Docker containers with their status and metadata.",
    responses={
        200: {"description": "List of containers"},
        401: {"description": "Unauthorized"},
        500: {"description": "Docker service unavailable"}
    },
    tags=["containers"]
)
async def list_containers(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    """
    List all containers.
    
    Returns information about all Docker containers, including:
    - Container ID
    - Name
    - Status (running, stopped, etc.)
    - Image
    - Ports
    - Created date
    
    Requires authentication.
    """
    # Implementation...
```

## 2. Frontend JSDoc Documentation

Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all React components:

```typescript
/**
 * ContainerDetail component displays detailed information about a Docker container.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Real-time status display
 * - Container logs viewer
 * - Action buttons (start, stop, restart)
 * - Resource usage metrics
 * 
 * @param {Object} props - Component props
 * @param {string} props.containerId - ID of the container to display
 * @returns {JSX.Element} Container detail view
 */
const ContainerDetail: React.FC<ContainerDetailProps> = ({ containerId }) => {
    // Implementation...
}
```

## 3. Docker Configuration

Create Docker configuration files for development and production:

1. Backend Dockerfile with proper layering
2. Frontend Dockerfile with build and runtime stages
3. docker-compose.yml for local development
4. docker-compose.prod.yml for production deployment

## 4. GitHub Actions Workflow

Implement CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions:

1. Test workflow for PRs
2. Build workflow for main branch
3. Deploy workflow for releases
4. Version tagging automation

## Technical Requirements

- Maintain 80% test coverage for all new code
- Follow the existing project structure and patterns
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Document all public APIs and components

## Starting Points

1. For API documentation, start with `backend/app/main.py`
2. For frontend documentation, begin with the key components in `frontend/src/components/`
3. For Docker configuration, create files in the project root
4. For GitHub Actions, create workflows in `.github/workflows/`

Please implement these components sequentially, committing changes with descriptive messages after completing each feature. This will ensure a clean, traceable development history and make code review easier.
