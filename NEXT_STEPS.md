# DockerDeployer: Next Development Steps

Based on our implementation of core Docker management functionality, let's continue development with the following priorities:

## 1. Frontend Dashboard Components

Implement the React components for the web dashboard:
- Container list view with status indicators
- Container detail view with logs and metrics
- Natural language command input with suggestions
- Template browser with filtering options

## 2. LLM Integration Module

Develop the LLM integration for processing natural language:
- Local LLM setup and configuration
- LiteLLM API client implementation
- Prompt templates for Docker operations
- Response parsing and error handling

## 3. Template Management System

Expand the template system:
- Create sample templates for common stacks (LEMP, MEAN, WordPress)
- Implement variable substitution in templates
- Add template validation and testing
- Design template browsing and selection UI

## 4. Testing Infrastructure

Establish comprehensive testing:
- Unit tests for Docker management functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock LLM responses for NLP testing
- End-to-end workflow tests

## 5. Authentication and Security

Implement security measures:
- User authentication system
- Role-based access control
- Secure storage of credentials
- Audit logging for all operations

Please prioritize the frontend dashboard and LLM integration to create a minimum viable product that demonstrates the core natural language functionality for Docker management.
