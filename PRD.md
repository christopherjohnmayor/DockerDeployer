# DockerDeployer: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction / Overview
DockerDeployer is an AI-powered tool that simplifies Docker deployment and management through natural language interaction. It addresses the complexity barrier of Docker by enabling users to create, manage, deploy, and maintain containerized web services using plain English commands. The system generates appropriate configuration files, handles deployment, and provides monitoring capabilities, all while supporting self-hosting and multiple LLM providers.

## 2. Goals / Objectives
**Primary Goal:** Reduce the complexity barrier in Docker deployment and management

**Specific Measurable Goals:**
- Enable developers to deploy multi-container applications using natural language in under 5 minutes, representing an 80% reduction in setup time compared to manual docker-compose processes
- Reduce configuration errors by 90% compared to manual setup by automatically implementing Docker best practices and security configurations

## 3. Target Audience / User Personas
**Primary Target Users (Initial Release)**
- Intermediate Docker Developers: Technical users with basic Docker knowledge who want to streamline their workflows and reduce time spent on configuration

**Secondary Target Users (Future Releases)**
- System Administrators: Managing multiple Docker environments across an organization
- Less Technical Users: Who want to deploy web services without learning Docker's complexity

## 4. User Stories / Use Cases
**Core User Stories**
- "As an intermediate developer, I want to quickly set up a microservice architecture with proper networking and dependencies using natural language, so that I can focus on application development rather than spending hours configuring Docker files and troubleshooting connection issues."
- "As a developer, I want to be able to browse a list of common application templates (e.g., LEMP stack, MEAN stack, WordPress) within the Web UI and deploy a selected template with minimal additional input, so I can get standard services running very quickly."
- "As a developer, I want to manage my running containers through natural language commands like 'show logs for the database container' or 'restart the web server', so I can perform routine maintenance tasks efficiently."
- "As a developer, I want my Docker configurations to be automatically version-controlled, so I can track changes and roll back to previous working states when needed."

## 5. Functional Requirements
**Natural Language Interface**
- Accept and process plain English commands for container creation, deployment, and management
- Support deployment of common web services and databases with appropriate configurations
- Enable management commands for logs, restarts, and resource monitoring
- Handle ambiguity by asking clarifying questions when needed

**Configuration Generation**
- Automatically generate docker-compose.yml and Dockerfiles based on user requirements
- Apply best practices and security configurations by default
- Support custom configuration options when specified

**Deployment and Management**
- Deploy containers locally with proper networking, volumes, and security settings
- Provide a web-based dashboard for monitoring container status and resource usage
- Enable version control integration for configuration files
- Support browsing and deploying from a library of built-in templates

**LLM Support**
- Support local LLMs for privacy and self-hosting capabilities
- Integrate with LiteLLM for unified API access (initial release)
- Plan for future support of OpenRouter, Gemini, and DeepSeek APIs

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
**Performance**
- Complete common deployment operations in under 5 minutes
- Dashboard should load within 3 seconds
- Support handling of at least 20 concurrent containers on standard hardware

**Security**
- Implement least-privilege container configurations by default
- Support secret management through environment variables
- Provide network isolation between container groups
- Include audit logging of all deployment and management actions

**Usability**
- Web UI should be intuitive and require minimal Docker knowledge
- Error messages should be clear and suggest potential solutions
- Provide contextual help and examples throughout the interface

**Self-Hosting**
- Minimum system requirements: 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, 20GB storage
- Support for air-gapped environments with local LLMs
- Modular architecture allowing components to scale independently

## 7. Design Considerations
**User Interface**
- Clean, modern web interface with container visualization
- Natural language input field prominently positioned
- Dashboard showing container status, logs, and resource usage
- Template library with filtering and search capabilities

**Architecture**
- Modular design separating NLP components from Docker management
- API-first approach to enable future extensions
- Container-based deployment of DockerDeployer itself

## 8. Success Metrics
- 80% reduction in deployment time compared to manual methods
- 90% reduction in configuration errors
- User satisfaction score of 8+ on a 10-point scale
- 80% of target users can complete a standard deployment without requiring documentation

## 9. Open Questions / Future Considerations
- Remote deployment capabilities via SSH (planned for future release)
- CLI interface as an alternative to web UI (planned for future release)
- Resource optimization suggestions using AI (planned for future release)
- Proactive updates and maintenance (planned for future release)
- Windows support (planned for future release)
- Integration with cloud providers for hybrid deployments

## 10. Implementation Phases
**Phase 1 (Initial Release)**
- Natural language interface for local deployments
- Web UI with monitoring dashboard
- Built-in templates for common stacks
- Version control integration
- Support for local LLMs and LiteLLM

**Phase 2**
- CLI interface
- Remote deployment via SSH
- Additional LLM provider integrations

**Phase 3**
- Resource optimization suggestions
- Proactive updates and maintenance
- Windows support
- Advanced CI/CD pipeline integration
