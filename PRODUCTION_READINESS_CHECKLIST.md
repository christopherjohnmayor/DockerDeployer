## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Fix Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
# Fix Material-UI testing patterns
# Update timeout configurations
# Resolve dialog state management
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Step 2: Verify CI/CD Pipeline

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve frontend test failures for production readiness"
git push origin main
# Verify GitHub Actions pass
```

### Step 3: Configure Production Environment

```bash
cp .env.production.example .env.production
# Update all production values
# Generate secure keys
# Configure email provider
# Set domain and SSL settings
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Production

```bash
./scripts/deploy-production.sh
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check health endpoints
curl https://your-domain.com/health
curl https://your-domain.com/api/containers

# Verify monitoring
# Check logs and metrics
# Test critical user flows
```

## üîß Quick Fixes Required

### Frontend Test Fixes (Priority 1)

1. **Material-UI Multiple Elements**: Use `getAllByText()` instead of `getByText()`
2. **Test Timeouts**: Increase timeout for async operations
3. **Dialog State Management**: Proper cleanup in AlertsManagement tests
4. **Tooltip Warnings**: Wrap disabled buttons in span elements

### Example Fix:

```typescript
// Before
expect(screen.getByText("Real-time")).toBeInTheDocument();

// After
expect(screen.getAllByText("Real-time")[0]).toBeInTheDocument();
```
