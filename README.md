# DockerDeployer

DockerDeployer is an AI-powered tool that simplifies Docker deployment and management through natural language interaction. It enables users to create, manage, deploy, and maintain containerized web services using plain English commands. The system generates configuration files, handles deployment, and provides monitoring capabilities, supporting both self-hosting and multiple LLM providers.

## Key Features (Phase 1)

- **Natural Language Interface:** Accepts plain English commands for Docker tasks (create, deploy, manage containers).
- **Configuration Generation:** Auto-generates `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` with best practices and security.
- **Deployment & Management:** Local deployment with proper networking, volumes, and security settings.
- **Web Dashboard:** Modern UI for monitoring containers, logs, and resource usage.
- **Template Library:** Deploy common stacks from a built-in template library.
- **Version Control:** Tracks configuration changes and enables rollbacks.
- **LLM Support:** Works with local LLMs and LiteLLM for natural language understanding.
