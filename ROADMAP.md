# DockerDeployer: Project Roadmap

## Project Overview

DockerDeployer is an AI-powered Docker container management system with a React/TypeScript frontend, FastAPI backend, Docker SDK integration, and LiteLLM for natural language processing of container management commands.

## Current Status

### Completed Components

#### 1. Frontend Dashboard MVP

- âœ… Implemented `ContainerDetail.tsx` with logs viewer and action buttons
- âœ… Enhanced `NaturalLanguageInput.tsx` with command history and suggestions
- âœ… Created advanced `Templates.tsx` with filtering, grid/table views, and template details
- âœ… Connected components to backend API endpoints using Axios

#### 2. LLM Integration

- âœ… Created prompt templates in `backend/llm/prompts/docker_commands.py`
- âœ… Implemented response parser in `backend/llm/engine/parser.py`
- âœ… Set up LLM client with provider switching capabilities

#### 3. Template System

- âœ… Created sample templates for LEMP, MEAN, and WordPress stacks
- âœ… Implemented template validator in `backend/templates/validator.py`
- âœ… Added template loading and deployment functionality

#### 4. Testing Framework

- âœ… Set up comprehensive backend testing with pytest
- âœ… Created test fixtures and mocks for Docker, LLM, and template components
- âœ… Implemented frontend testing with React Testing Library
- âœ… Added test coverage configuration with 80% threshold
- âœ… Created unified test commands in package.json
- âœ… Achieved 80% test coverage threshold for both backend and frontend

**Technical Details:**

- Backend testing uses pytest with custom fixtures for Docker, LLM, and database components
- Frontend testing uses Jest and React Testing Library with mocked API responses
- Test coverage is enforced through CI pipeline and configuration in `pytest.ini` and `package.json`
- Relevant files: `backend/tests/`, `frontend/src/**/*.test.tsx`, `pytest.ini`, `frontend/jest.config.js`

#### 5. Authentication System

- âœ… Implemented JWT-based authentication with token refresh
- âœ… Created user database models with SQLAlchemy
- âœ… Added login and registration pages in the frontend
- âœ… Implemented role-based access control (Admin and User roles)
- âœ… Secured all API endpoints with appropriate authorization checks

**Technical Details:**

- JWT authentication with access and refresh tokens
- Role-based permissions (Admin vs. User)
- Token refresh mechanism to maintain sessions
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Frontend authentication state management with React Context
- Relevant files: `backend/app/auth/`, `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`, `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`

#### 6. Documentation

- âœ… Enhanced FastAPI app with comprehensive OpenAPI annotations
- âœ… Created custom Swagger UI with authentication support
- âœ… Added detailed model schemas with examples and descriptions
- âœ… Updated README.md with project overview, features, and setup instructions
- âœ… Created TEMPLATES.md with template format specification and examples

**Technical Details:**

- OpenAPI documentation accessible at `/docs` with authentication support
- All API endpoints documented with descriptions, examples, and response models
- Proper tagging for API endpoint groups
- Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- Detailed template documentation with format specification and examples
- Relevant files: `backend/app/main.py`, `README.md`, `TEMPLATES.md`

#### 7. Docker Configuration

- âœ… Dockerfile for the backend with proper layering
- âœ… Dockerfile for the frontend with build and runtime stages
- âœ… docker-compose.yml for local development
- âœ… docker-compose.prod.yml for production deployment
- âœ… Nginx configuration for production deployment

**Technical Details:**

- Multi-stage Docker builds for optimized images
- Docker Compose for orchestration in both development and production
- Nginx as a reverse proxy with SSL support
- Health checks for all services
- Volume management for persistent data
- Relevant files: `backend/Dockerfile`, `frontend/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`, `nginx/nginx.prod.conf`

#### 8. CI/CD Pipeline

- âœ… GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- âœ… Build workflow for packaging on merge to main
- âœ… Deployment workflow for staging/production
- âœ… Automated version tagging and release creation

**Technical Details:**

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- Separate workflows for testing, building, and deployment
- Automated Docker image building and pushing
- Deployment to staging and production environments
- Backup creation during production deployments
- Relevant files: `.github/workflows/test.yml`, `.github/workflows/build.yml`, `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
