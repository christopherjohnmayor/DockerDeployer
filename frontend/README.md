# DockerDeployer Frontend

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React (with TypeScript)
- **UI Library:** Material-UI (MUI) for modern, responsive components
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit (for scalable state handling)
- **Networking:** Axios (for API requests)
- **Visualization:** Recharts (for resource usage graphs)
- **Build Tool:** Vite (for fast development and builds)
- **Testing:** Jest + React Testing Library

## UI Plan

### Key Screens & Components

1. **Dashboard**
   - Overview of all running containers (status, resource usage)
   - Quick actions: start/stop/restart, view logs
   - Resource graphs (CPU, memory, network)

2. **Natural Language Command Input**
   - Prominently positioned input box for plain English commands
   - Command history and suggestions
   - Clarification dialogs for ambiguous requests

3. **Template Library**
   - Browse/search/filter built-in stack templates (e.g., LEMP, MEAN, WordPress)
   - Deploy template with minimal input
   - Template details and customization options

4. **Logs & Monitoring**
   - Real-time logs for selected containers
   - Resource usage breakdown per container

5. **Version Control Panel**
   - View configuration history (docker-compose, Dockerfiles)
   - Rollback to previous states
   - Commit messages and diffs

6. **Settings**
   - LLM provider selection (local, LiteLLM)
   - Secret management
   - System info and requirements

### UX Principles

- Minimal Docker knowledge required
- Clear error messages and contextual help
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet
- Modern, clean, and intuitive interface
