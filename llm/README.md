# LLM Integration - DockerDeployer

## Overview

This module handles integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) to power the natural language interface of DockerDeployer. It is responsible for interpreting user commands, generating Docker configurations, and providing intelligent responses.

## Phase 1 Scope

- **Local LLM Support:** Enable running open-source LLMs locally for privacy and air-gapped environments.
- **LiteLLM Integration:** Provide unified API access to multiple LLM providers via LiteLLM.
- **Abstraction Layer:** Expose a simple API for the rest of DockerDeployer to send/receive natural language queries and responses.

## Planned Features

- Model selection (local or remote via LiteLLM)
- Prompt engineering and context management
- Error handling and fallback strategies
- Modular design for future LLM providers (OpenRouter, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc.)

## Directory Structure

- `llm/engine/` — Core logic for LLM communication
- `llm/prompts/` — Prompt templates and context management
- `llm/providers/` — Integrations for local and remote LLMs
- `llm/tests/` — Unit and integration tests

## Example API

- `generate_docker_compose(user_request: str) -> str`
- `clarify_ambiguous_command(user_request: str) -> str`
- `summarize_logs(container_logs: str) -> str`

## Configuration

- Environment variables for API keys, model paths, and provider selection
- Secure handling of secrets

## Future Considerations

- Support for additional LLM APIs
- Fine-tuning and custom model support
- Usage analytics and performance monitoring

This module is critical for enabling natural, conversational Docker management as described in the PRD.
