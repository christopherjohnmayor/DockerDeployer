# NLP Module

## Overview
The NLP module is responsible for processing natural language commands from users and translating them into actionable intents for Docker deployment and management. It serves as the interface between the userâ€™s plain English instructions and the backend logic that generates Docker configurations, manages containers, and interacts with other system modules.

## Responsibilities

- Parse and interpret user input in plain English.
- Identify user intent (e.g., deploy, create, manage, monitor containers).
- Extract relevant entities and parameters (e.g., service names, ports, environment variables).
- Handle ambiguity by generating clarifying questions when necessary.
- Generate structured requests for the backend API (e.g., JSON payloads).
- Support contextual conversation for multi-step workflows.
- Integrate with local LLMs and LiteLLM for language understanding.
- Provide error handling and user feedback for unsupported or unclear commands.

## Interfaces

- Receives raw text input from the frontend (web UI).
- Communicates parsed intents and parameters to the backend API.
- Receives clarifying questions or error messages from the backend and relays them to the frontend.

## Extensibility

- Designed to support additional LLM providers in the future.
- Modular intent and entity extraction to allow for new Docker features and commands.
- Configurable prompt templates and language models.
