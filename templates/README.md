# DockerDeployer Templates

## Overview

The `templates` directory contains pre-built, production-ready Docker deployment templates for common application stacks and services. These templates are designed to accelerate deployment, reduce configuration errors, and embody Docker best practices and security standards.

## Template Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Templates should enable users to deploy complex stacks with minimal input, abstracting away repetitive or error-prone configuration details.
- **Best Practices**: All templates must follow Docker and security best practices, including least-privilege configurations, proper networking, and secret management.
- **Customizability**: While templates provide sensible defaults, they should be easily customizable through natural language or configuration overrides.
- **Transparency**: Generated files and configurations should be clear and well-documented, allowing users to understand and modify as needed.
- **Versioned**: All templates are version-controlled to ensure traceability and rollback capability.

## Template Types

- **Web Stacks**: LEMP, MEAN, WordPress, etc.
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
- **Utilities**: Reverse proxies, monitoring tools, etc.
- **Custom**: User-defined templates for specific use cases.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure templates are modular and reusable.
- Include a brief description and usage instructions in each template folder.
- Validate templates for compatibility with the DockerDeployer system and supported environments.
